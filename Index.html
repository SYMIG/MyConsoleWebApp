            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.
            An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window.
            To open the console in Microsoft Edge, you can use the shortcut: Control + Shift + I. 
            As an alternative, you can right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect" to open the developer console.
            In the window that opens, click the "Console" tab.
            In the JavaScript file, use console.log() method to print on console.
